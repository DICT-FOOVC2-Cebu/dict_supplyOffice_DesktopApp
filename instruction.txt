First is you must create this in the Xampp database first

 	 Database Name = "dict_inventory_system";
         Username = "dictUser";
         Password = "zJXnJx5um7RHCk9u";

Note: create the Username and Password into XAMPP Priviledges

Second is import the database  name dict_inventory_system.sql after you create the database "dict_inventory_system".

The Login account in DICT admin is
	username:admin
	password:123456

In Login Account for DICT Supply office is
	username:ebdayangco
	password:123456

	Or

	username:jcorona
	password:corona111

then thats it! Good Luck!
